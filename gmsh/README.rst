Description
-----------


Adds interfaces to a 2D or 3D structure created with Gmsh.  See ``run.sh`` for running an example structure.

An optional yaml file can be used to configure additional behavior.
Please see ``ring.yaml`` for an example.

Recommended Usage
-----------------

Create a .geo file with physical groups labeling volumes and surfaces.  The surfaces should denote contact boundary conditions.  Running the script will add interfaces.  It will also ensure that the interfaces do not share vertices with any other interfaces or contacts.

The input mesh must be created with the older Gmsh format.  Using ``examples/mobility/gmsh_mos2d.msh`` in the devsim distribution as an example:

::

  gmsh -2 -format 'msh2' gmsh_mos2d.geo


::

  python test_convert.py  --input_mesh gmsh_mos2d.msh  --output_mesh foo.msh 

The mesh can then be loaded in devsim for simulation.

The user should look in the updated msh file for the names:

::

  $PhysicalNames
  9
  1 1 "gate_contact"
  1 2 "gate_oxide_interface"
  1 4 "source_contact"
  1 5 "drain_contact"
  1 6 "body_contact"
  2 7 "gate"
  2 8 "oxide"
  2 9 "bulk"
  1 11 "bulk_oxide"
  $EndPhysicalNames

where the 1st column is the dimension of the physical group, and the last column is its name when loaded into devsim.

Troubleshooting
---------------

If the input mesh file has surfaces which overlap, it will return an error.

::

  RuntimeError: overlapping elements between priority_name bulk_oxide_interface and boundary of higher priority drain_contact
  overlapping elements between priority_name source_contact and boundary of higher priority bulk_oxide_interface

Removing the ``bulk_oxide_interface`` physical name in the input file fixes the issue.

::

  $PhysicalNames
  9
  1 1 "gate_contact"
  1 2 "gate_oxide_interface"
  1 3 "bulk_oxide_interface"
  1 4 "source_contact"
  1 5 "drain_contact"
  1 6 "body_contact"
  2 7 "gate"
  2 8 "oxide"
  2 9 "bulk"
  $EndPhysicalNames

and the resultant physical names are the same as the previous section, with these warnings:

::

  removed 11/11 elements from gate_oxide for overlap with other boundary
  generated surface gate_oxide removed for 0 elements
  removed 2/152 elements from bulk_oxide for overlap with other boundary

Notice that 2 elements were removed from the ``bulk_oxide`` interface for conflicting with other boundary conditions, specifically ``source_contact`` and ``drain_contact``.  This is important because such overlaps can result in convergence issues in simulation.
